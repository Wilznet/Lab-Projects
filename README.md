# Lab-Projects
Just a simple repo where I save my working CCNA labs as I finish them. Everything inside has been built, tested, and is 100% working in Packet Tracer.
Currently includes:
GRE hub-and-spoke with OSPF over tunnels, Remote Access IPsec VPN. More labs will be added 

Each lab folder contains:

The .pkt file (open it and everything works)
Topology screenshot
Final running-configs for all routers
Quick verification commands

Feel free to clone and use for your own study. No fancy stuff, just labs that work.
